This README file is for our reminder app - Remindly . Agile sprint methdology was integrated in this group project. The majority of the code is written in javascript and ejs integrated into ejs files using Visual studio code. 
Our team collaborated over Visual studio code live share to collaborate in real time and continous integration was done through Github Workflow.

The target audience for the app is students or anyone that is looking for a really simple to use reminder app. It has features like:

1. Creating user accounts
2. Creating Reminders
3. It allows adding subtasks to reminders.
4. Subtasks could be ticked off, once completed. 
5. You can also edit the previously created reminders and subtasks.
6. You can add other users as friends and see their created reminders to help users collaborate with each other.

This project took us 5 weeks of work, consisting 5 total sprints. Honestly, we did face some problems during the collaboration but it was minimal and we handeled it.
The aim of this project was to create a really simple to use reminder app with some really functional integrated features that do the job while learning Agile project management, continous integration and delivery.

Some other platforms we used in this project were, 
Discord for communication
Trello for Collaboration
